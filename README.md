Sales and Refunds Analysis
Project Description
This project analyzes sales and refunds data for a British company specializing in office infrastructure. The VP of Sales seeks to use a data-driven approach to reduce refunds by forecasting sales and predicting refunds category-wise for the upcoming year. Tableau is the chosen BI tool to create visualizations and forecasts to aid in strategic planning.

Business Scenario
The company has seen steady sales growth but is experiencing a high rate of customer refunds. The VP of Sales desires a methodical and data-driven approach to develop strategies for minimizing refunds. This project aims to create a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to visualize sales and refunds data and provide actionable insights.

Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

Sales Forecast: Forecast sales for the next year using historical data.
Refund Prediction: Predict the probability of refunds category-wise for the next year.
Dashboard Creation: Develop a Tableau dashboard that includes:
A list of orders returned by customers from the top 10 countries with the highest refunds.
A world map highlighting the top 10 countries with the most refunds.
Predictions of refunds for the next year, categorized by product category.
A URL action to provide detailed country-specific information.
